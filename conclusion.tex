\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented the first verified compiler of a non-strict lambda calculus.
In addition to proving that our call-by-need semantics is preserved through
compilation, we have proved that Curien's calculus of closures is implemented by
our call-by-name semantics. We argue that this provides compelling evidence that
our compiler is a true verified compiler of call-by-need.

We hope that this work can serve as a foundation for future work on real-world
verified compilers. While it is clearly a toy compiler, we have reason to
believe that performance is acceptable and can be further improved \cite{cem}.
In combination with efforts to formalize semantics of real-world languages like
Haskell, we hope that this work can help us move towards fully verified
non-strict programs.
