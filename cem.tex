\section{Source Semantics} \label{cem_big}

In this section we define with our big step source semantics. Big step semantics
have the advantage of powerful, easy to use induction properties. This eases
reasoning about many program properties. We'll also define a small step
semantics and prove that it implements the big step semantics, but by showing
that our implementation preserves the big-step semantics, we prove preservation
of any inductive reasoning on the structure of evaluation tree.  

As discussed in Section~\ref{intro}, our source semantics is lambda calculus
with deBruijn indices. 
\begin{align*}
 t &::= t \; t \; | \; x \; | \;  \lambda \; t \\
 x &\in \mathbb{N}
\end{align*}
The essence of the $\mathcal{CE}$ semantics is that we implement a shared
environment, and use its structure to share results of computations. This allows
for a simple abstract machine which can operate on lambda calculus directly,
preventing needing to reason about lambda lifting and indirections due to
closure size changes. We operate on closures, which combine terms with
pointers into the shared environment, which is implemented as a heap. Every
heap location points to a cell, which contains a closure and a pointer to the
next environment location if necessary. Variable dereferences index into this
shared environment structure, while the binding of a new variable extends the
shared environment structure with a new cell. Applications evaluate the left
hand side to an abstraction, then extend the environment with the argument term
closed under the environment pointer at the environment of the application. The
application rule enforces the fact that two variables bound to the same argument
closure will point to the same location in the shared environment. Because the
point to the same location by construction of the shared environment, we can use
this property to update that location with the value computed at the first
variable dereference, and then each subsequent dereference will point to this
value. The variable rule applies the update by indexing into the shared
environment structure and replacing the closure at that location with the
resulting value. The big step semantics are described in the standard way by
logical relation in Figure~\ref{fig:bigstep}. The \texttt{update $\Psi$ x v}
function replaces the closure at location \texttt{x} in heap $\Psi$ with value
\texttt{v}. The curly brackets construct a heap cell containing a closure and a
environment continuation. The \texttt{app} constructor represents an application,
while the \texttt{var} constructor is a variable constructor and $\lambda$ is
the constructor for an abstraction. The \texttt{clu} function looks up a
variable index in the shared environment structure by following environment
continuation pointers.  The $\langle \Phi \rangle \texttt{c}$ notation
constructs a configuration from a heap $\Phi$ and a closure \texttt{c}. Note
that we require that fresh variables are greater than zero. This is required
for reasoning about compilation to the instruction machine, which we will
return to in Section~\ref{sec:im}.

In addition to the above description there are some important properties to
notice for the purpose of verification. One is that we specify that in addition
to requiring that a heap location for a new bound closure is fresh, we require
that the it is positive. While not necessary for the correctness of the
semantics, this will be useful later when defining a relation between the heap
described here and the machine code heap, ensuring that we don't artificially
extend the empty environment. It's also worth noting that while the closures in
the heap cells are mutable, the shared environment structure is never mutated.
This property is crucial when reasoning about variable dereferences. 

The astute reader will notice that the freshness constraint is also stronger
than necessary. In reality, we'd like to have a notion of liveness and heap
re-use.  We'll return to this in Section~\ref{discussion} with an informal
argument that this should be possible in future work. For this paper, this
simpler property helps simplify reasoning about correctness.  

The fact that our natural semantics are defined on lambda calculus with deBruijn
tindices differs from existing definitions of call-by-need, such as Ariola's
call-by-need \cite{ariola} or Launchbury's lazy semantics \cite{launchbury}.
These semantics are defined on lambda calculus with named variables. While it
should be possible to relate our semantics to these \footnote{Both of these well
known existing semantics have known bugs, as discussed in
Section~\ref{discussion}}, it is certainly made more difficult by this
disparity. A more fruitful relation to semantics operating on lambda calculus
with named variables would likely be relating curiens calculus of closures to
call-by-name semanticss implemented with substitution. We'll return to this
discussion in Section~\ref{discussion}.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{intro}, these big step semantics don't explicitly
include a notion of nontermination. Instead, nontermination would be implied by
the negation of the existence of an evaluation relation. This prevents reasoning
directly about nontermination in an inductive way, but for our the purpose of
our primary lemma this is fine. 

One interesting property of defining an inductive evaluation relation in a
language like Coq is that we can do computation on the evaluation tree. In other
words, the evaluation relation given above defines a data type, one that we can
do computation on in standard ways. For example, we could potentially compute
properties like size and depth, which would be related to operational properties
of compiled code. We hope in future work to explore this approach further.

\subsection{Call-By-Name}

In this section we define a call-by-name variant of our big step semantics and
prove that it is an implementation of Curien's call-by-name calculus of
closures \cite{curien}. 

See Figure~\ref{fig:bigstepname} for the definition of our call-by-name
semantics. Note that the only change from our call-by-need semantics is that we
don't update the heap location with the result of the dereferenced computation.
This is the essence of the difference between call-by-name and call-by-need.

A well known existing call-by-name semantics is Curien's calculus of closures
\cite{curien}. Refer to Figure~\ref{fig:curien} for a formalization of this
semantics. This semantics defines closures as a term, environment pair, where an
environment is a list of closures. Abstractions are in weak head normal form,
variables index into the environment using the \texttt{nth\_error} standard
library function, and applications evaluate the left hand side to a value, then
extend the environment of the value with the closure of the argument. 

We define a heterogeneous equivalence relation between our shared environment
structure and Curien's structure. Effectively, this relation is the claim that
the shared environment structure is a linked list implementation of the
environment list in Curien's semantics. This is defined inductively, and we
require that every closure reachable in the environment is also equivalent.  We
say two closures are equivalent if their terms are identical and their
environments are equivalent. 

Given these definitions, we can prove that our call-by-name semantics implement
Curien's call by name semantics: 

\begin{theorem}
If a closure $c$ in Curien's call-by-name semantics is equivalent to a
configuration $c'$, and $c$ steps to $v$, then there exists a $v'$ that our
call-by-name semantics steps to that is equivalent to $v$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proofoutline}
The proof proceeds by induction on Curien's step relation. The abstraction rule
is a trivial base case. The variable lookup rule uses a helper lemma that proves
by induction on the variable that if the two environments are equivalent and the
\texttt{nth\_error} function looks up a closure, then the \texttt{clu} function
will look up an equivalent closure. The application rule uses a helper lemma
proves that a fresh allocation will keep any equivalent environments equivalent,
and that the new environment defined by the fresh allocation will be equivalent
to the extended environment of Curien's semantics.
\end{proofoutline}

By proving that Curien's semantics is implemented by the call-by-name variant of
our semantics, we provide further evidence that our call-by-need is a
meaningful semantics. While eventually we'd like to prove that the call-by-need
semantics implement an optimization of the call-by-name, we leave that for
future work.
