Call-by-need semantics are widely used in the programming language Haskell.
Unfortunately, unlike their call-by-value counterparts, there are no verified
compilers for call-by-need. In this paper we present the first verified compiler
for call-by-need semantics. We discuss some of the difficulties in verifying
call-by-need, and show how we overcome them.
